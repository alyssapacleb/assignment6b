 Instructions:
 This view will display and update the adventurer's stats in real time
 
 A UITextView will act as the "quest log" where the user can see how their adventurer is faring against the enemies.
 
 A timer will determine when the adventurer can act, and at every timer event, the adventurer will attack based on the attack multiplier and a range of randomness. This will damage the "enemy" for a certain number of hit points. If the enemy dies, a new one will immediately spawn. If the adventurer defeats enough enemies, the adventurer will level up.
 
 Another timer will determine when the enemy can act, and at every timer event, the enemy will either attack for damage within a range (randomized), or wait. When the enemy attacks, the adventurer takes damage. If the adventurer's hit points go to zero or less, the adventurer's current hit points will be set to zero, and the quest will end (i.e. the timers will stop running).
 
 The quest log will output text for all events that happen during the timer, and while the exact wording of this text is up to you, it should include relevant details such as who attacked whom and for how much damage.
